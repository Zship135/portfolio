                    4/22/2025

                        As a college student I am always looking for opportunities to learn new skills and improve my 
                    knowledge. I saw some IT professionals on LinkedIn recently discussing powershell and I recognized
                    that I had never used it before and wanted to learn it. I have always been interested in getting started
                    but was not quite sure how to begin. 
                        Since I recently got a new laptop I have been appreciating the clean Windows Install. Over some 
                    time I have been installing various softwares and programs for school and personal use.
                    I want to keep this as best I can and figured Powershell's ability to automate file management
                    is the perfect way to start!
                        The script I made is simple but effective. The idea is the have a script that will search your files
                    and calculate the last time it was opened, and if that time exceeds a threshold, it will put it
                    into a "archive" folder.

                        I first had to make some variables to hold the paths of my downloads folder and the new archive folder.
                    I also set the threshold to 30 days at the top of the program.
                    <pre class = "code-block">
                        $downloadsFolder = [Environment]::GetFolderPath("UserProfile") + "\Downloads"
                        $archiveFolder = Join-Path -Path $downloadsFolder -ChildPath "Archived_Files"
                        $daysThreshold = 30

                        $currentDate = Get-Date
                    </pre>
                        The next step was to check if the archive folder exists, and if not, then create it.
                    This is done with the Test-Path cmdlet.
                    <pre class = "code-block">
                        if (-not (Test-Path $archiveFolder)) {
                            New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $archiveFolder
                        }
                    </pre>
                            So now that the folder is created, we have to search through the downloads folder and calculate
                    the time between the last access time and the current time.
                    This is done with the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, which gets all the files in the downloads folder.
                    <pre class = "code-block">
                        $files = Get-childItem -Path $downloadsFolder -File

                        $filesToArchive = $files | Where-Object {
                            $lastAccess = $_.LastAccessTime
                            $fileAge = $currentDate - $lastAccess
                            $fileAge.Days -ge $daysThreshold
                        }

                        foreach ($file in $filesToArchive) {
                            # Move the file to the archive folder
                            $destination = Join-Path -Path $archiveFolder -ChildPath $file.Name
                        
                            try {
                                # Move file
                                Move-Item -Path $file.FullName -Destination $destination
                                Write-Host "Archived: $($file.Name)"
                            } catch {
                                Write-Host "Failed to archive: $($file.Name)"
                            }
                        }
                    </pre>
                        This program is short and simple, but is a great way to learn the basics of Powershell.
                    From this project I was able to better organize my files and learn how to use Powershell to automate tasks.
